# Claude Code Instructions for Pak

This file is automatically read by Claude Code at session startup.
Follow these instructions when working in this repository.

## Automatic Validation (read this first)

**Every `.pak` file you write or edit is automatically validated by the Pak
compiler via a PostToolUse hook.** You do not need to run it manually.

When a file fails validation, you will see output like:

```
============================================================
PAK VALIDATION FAILED: path/to/file.pak
============================================================
error[E002]: 1:4: Expected identifier (got FN 'fn')
  --> path/to/file.pak
  help: ...

Fix the errors above before proceeding.
Reference LANGUAGE.md and NOT_SUPPORTED.md.
============================================================
```

**When this happens:**
1. Read the error message carefully — it includes line, column, and error code.
2. Look up the correct construct in `LANGUAGE.md`.
3. Check `NOT_SUPPORTED.md` if the error suggests you used something that doesn't exist.
4. Fix the file. The hook will re-run automatically on the next write.
5. Repeat until the hook exits cleanly (no output).

**Do not move on until the file passes.** A `.pak` file that does not pass
`pak check` is incorrect Pak code, regardless of how plausible it looks.

You can also run the validator manually at any time:
```
tools/validate_pak.sh file.pak
pak check file.pak
```

## Before Generating Any Pak Code

Read these files **in order** before writing or modifying `.pak` files:

1. **`LANGUAGE.md`** — the canonical syntax reference. Every construct you write must appear here.
2. **`NOT_SUPPORTED.md`** — hard list of things Pak does not have. If something is on this list, do not use it.
3. **`STDLIB.md`** — all builtin functions and N64 API modules. Do not invent function signatures.
4. **`examples/canonical/`** — small, correct reference examples. Prefer patterns shown here.

If a language feature is not documented in `LANGUAGE.md` and not demonstrated
in `examples/canonical/`, do not use it. State uncertainty instead of guessing.

---

## Rules

- **Use only documented syntax.** No inventing keywords, operators, or constructs.
- **Use only documented APIs.** No inventing module names, function names, or signatures.
- **Prefer canonical examples** as templates for structure and style.
- **Mark implementation status.** `LANGUAGE.md` labels each feature `[IMPLEMENTED]`,
  `[PARTIAL]`, or `[PLANNED]`. Do not use `[PLANNED]` features in generated code.
- **Comments** use `--` (preferred) or `//`.
- **No semicolons** except where shown — Pak is mostly newline-delimited.
- **Entry point** is `entry { ... }`, not `main()` or `fn main`.
- **Logical operators** are `and`, `or`, `not` — never `&&`, `||`, `!`.
- **All casts are explicit** with `as` — no implicit numeric conversion.
- **Null is `none`** — the keyword `null` does not exist.

## When in Doubt

- Do not guess. Say "I'm not sure if Pak supports X — it's not in LANGUAGE.md."
- Do not use Rust, Zig, or C idioms unless they appear verbatim in Pak docs.
- If you need a feature that is `[PLANNED]`, say so and ask whether to implement a workaround.
- If the compiler rejects your code, trust the compiler over your intuition.

## Error Code Reference

When the compiler reports an error, use this table to understand it:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| E001 | Lex error — invalid character or unterminated string |
| E002 | Parse error — syntax is wrong |
| E101 | Undefined variable or function |
| E102 | Wrong number of arguments |
| E103 | No `entry` block found |
| E201 | DMA used without `cache.writeback` first |
| E202 | DMA buffer not `@aligned(16)` |
| E301 | Non-exhaustive match — missing cases |
| E401 | Use-after-move |
| W001–W003 | Style warnings (naming conventions) |

## Quick Reference

```pak
-- comment syntax
use n64.display          -- import N64 module
asset bg: Sprite from "bg.png"  -- load asset

const MAX: i32 = 100

struct Foo { x: i32, y: f32 }

enum Dir { north, south, east, west }

variant Shape {
    circle(f32)
    rect(f32, f32)
}

fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 { return a + b }

impl Foo {
    fn new(self: *Foo) { self.x = 0 }
}

entry {
    let x: i32 = 42
    loop { ... }
}
```

See `LANGUAGE.md` for the full grammar.
